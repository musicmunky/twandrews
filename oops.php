				<p>Hey there, friend!  It looks like you've stumbled onto this page because you've sent a few too many requests to my server!</p>
				<p>There could be any number of reasons for this - aliens, your cat learned to use your computer, the CIA...who knows??</p>
				<p>The point is, I'd like to know a little more about you!  Why, you ask?  Well see, this is a private server and I use it for my personal projects.</p>
				<p>It's kept up and running out of my own pocket, and if certain things get out of hand (bandwidth, API calls, etc) it actually costs me real money.</p>
				<p>I'm sure you're a nice person though, so please don't be offended or insulted!  If you had a legitimate reason for making requests to my server, please feel free to let me know!</p>
				<p>If you want to contact me you can find my email address on my <a href="https://github.com/musicmunky" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>
				<p>Feel free to drop me a line and let me know how I can help you out!</p>
				<p>All the best,</p>
				<p>tim</p>
